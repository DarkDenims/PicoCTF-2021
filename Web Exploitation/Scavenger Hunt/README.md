# Scavenger Hunt

## Problem

> There is some interesting information hidden around this site <http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/>. Can you find it?

## Solution

These are the URLs that contain the flags:

1. view-source:<http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/>: `<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->`

2. <http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/mycss.css>: `/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */`

3. <http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/myjs.js>: `/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */` so lets go to <http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/robots.txt> and find `Part 3: t_0f_pl4c` and well as `I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?`

4. <http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.htaccess>: `Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k` and `I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.`

5. <http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.DS_Store>: `Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _f7ce8828}`
