# GET aHEAD

## Problem

> Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition <http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/>

## Solution

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept the request of clicking the "Choose Blue" button.
2. Change the POST request to a HEAD request:

    ```
    HEAD /index.php HTTP/1.1
    Host: mercury.picoctf.net:47967
    Content-Length: 0
    Origin: http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967
    Connection: close
    ```

3. The returned HTML from the HEAD request in the browser will be empty, but in the HTTP history tab of Proxy in Burp Suite you can find the flag as a HTTP header in the response:

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_cca66bd3}
    Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    ```

### Flag

`picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_cca66bd3}`
