# What's your input?

## Problem

> We'd like to get your input on a couple things. Think you can answer my questions correctly? in.py nc mercury.picoctf.net 39137.

* [in.py](./in.py)

## Solution

1. Look at the [in.py](./in.py) file, which is executed using Python 2.
2. The Python 2 input function is vulnerable. More info on [GeesForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vulnerability-input-function-python-2-x/).
3. We can enter the variable name `city` as the city input parameter which will essentially set `res = city`.
