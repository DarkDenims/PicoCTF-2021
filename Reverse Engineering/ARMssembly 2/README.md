# ARMssembly 2

## Problem

> What integer does this program print with argument 4189673334? File: chall_2.S Flag format: picoCTF{XXXXXXXX} -> (hex, lowercase, no 0x, and 32 bits. ex. 5614267 would be picoCTF{0055aabb})

* [Source](./chall_2.S)

## Solution

1. This challenge can be solved using the exact same method as [ARMssembly 0](../ARMssembly%200/README.md).

2. Note that when running the binary with QEMU for this challenge, it took a few seconds to produce the output.

### Flag

`picoCTF{ed2c0662}`
